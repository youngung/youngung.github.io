  abstract={A novel elasto-visco-plastic self-consistent (EVPSC)
  formulation based on the scheme of the homogeneous effective medium is
   presented. The constitutive behavior of a polycrystal is described as
    that of an elasto-visco-plastic effective medium interacting with
    grains treated as elasto-visco-plastic ellipsoidal inclusions. The
    formulation is based on the definition of a unique
    elasto-visco-plastic compliance, so avoiding the inconsistency
    arising from assuming superimposed elastic and visco-plastic
    interaction laws, as made in similar elasto-visco-plastic models.
    In addition, the elasto-visco-plastic constitutive equation of
    crystal and aggregate is formulated in terms of stress increments,
    which leads naturally to a semi implicit solution scheme. The
    superior numerical stability and computational efficiency of the new
    incremental EVPSC model (denoted as $\Delta$EVPSC) are demonstrated
    by applying the model to a 316L austenitic stainless steel and
    comparing against other elasto-plastic models. The modeling
    capability for predicting texture, stress-strain response, and
    Bauschinger effect are demonstrated using a dislocation-density
    based hardening law applied to low carbon (LC) steel subjected to
    deformation histories that involve strain-path changes.}

  abstract={The EVPSC model is a general elasto-visco-plastic
  self-consistent constitutive formalism based on a Homogeneous
  Effective Medium (HEM) approach that accounts explicitly for
  microstructural features such as slip, twinning, and crystallographic
  texture. $\Delta$EVPSC is improved with respect to the original model
  reported in (Jeong and Tom√©, 2020) by introducing an intermediate
  linearization scheme, which leads to better predictive accuracy of
  intergranular stress and strain distributions in the polycrystal. The
  $\Delta$EVPSC model is interfaced with a commercial finite element
  solver Abaqus/standard as a user-defined material subroutine
  (EVPSC-FE). EVPSC-FE shows superior numerical stability and, when
  using parallel computation and 40 CPU core units, it reduces the
  computation time by a factor 20 compared to using a single CPU core
  unit for a structure consisting of 512 solid elements. The
  $\Delta$EVPSC-FE model is applied to FE analyses of Zr and low-carbon
  steel bars subjected to a sequence of bending, stress-relaxation, and
  unloading. It is shown that the hereditary effect is responsible for
  the spring-forward motion during the early stage of unloading, while
  the elastic recovery mainly drives the subsequent spring-back.},

  the first time, to predict springback responses after various amounts
  of prestrains. The crystallographic orientation distribution obtained
  from an EBSD scan was used to assign the initial polycrystalline
  aggregate for each FE integration point. The RGVB
  dislocation-density-based hardening model was adopted as the
  constitutive law, and the parameters were characterized by fitting
  uniaxial tension and tension-compression flow stress curves. The
  numerical reliability of the FE simulation results was evaluated via a
  systematic numerical study in terms of the mesh size, the numbers of
  grains sampled per each FE integration point and the cross-section
  points. The model successfully predicts the effect of prestrain on the
  springback, thus implying that the current modeling approach can be
  directly applied to industrial forming and springback predictions.},

  density on individual slip systems and accounts for static recovery effects. The model captures the

  understanding of the coupling between thermal, elastic and plastic mechanisms, and the important role

  abstract={The incremental elasto-visco-plastic self-consistent polycrystal model ($\Delta$EVPSC)
  was utilized to describe the constitutive behavior of dual-phase 980 (DP980) steel. A simple baseline
  modeling approach was chosen: the hardening behavior of each constituent phase in the DP980 steel
  was described by a simple Voce hardening law without explicitly considering the back stress; and it
  was assumed that using the same single crystal elastic modulus for ferrite and martensite is sufficiently
  representative. The adequacy of this baseline modeling approach was evaluated by comparing various
  mechanical experimental data with model predictions in terms of the stress vs. strain curves obtained
  from uniaxial tension, tension-compression, and loading-unloading-loading (LUL) tests. Additionally,
  the evolution of experimental lattice strain data reported in literature was used to validate the
  phase-specific Voce hardening parameters. Despite its minimalistic modeling description, the baseline
  $\Delta$EVPSC model successfully captured key features: 1) the Bauschinger effect, 2) the decrease
  in chord modulus, and 3) the non-linearity in the stress vs. strain curves resulting from the LUL
  test. All three mentioned characteristics are crucial for accurate prediction of springback in sheet
  metals. The $\Delta$EVPSC model, interfaced with a finite element solver (Abaqus/standard) as the
  user material subroutine, was employed to simulate the Numisheet93 benchmark problem. The strip of
  DP980 was first U-drawn followed by springback. The model-predicted springback profile aligned well
  with the experimental results only when stress relaxation was properly considered, resulting in
  improved predictive accuracy compared to predictions based on a distortional plasticity model.}

  abstract={ highly deformable Mg-Zn-Nd-Y-Zr alloy was investigated in terms of anisotropic and
  temperature-dependent mechanical behavior, with an emphasis on the microstructural changes.
  Uniaxial tension tests were conducted along the rolling (RD) and transverse (TD) directions
  at room temperature (298 K) and at 498 K, during which a series of ex-situ EBSD scans were
  obtained. In addition to quantitative texture analysis based on the EBSD scans, the relative
  contributions of various slip systems were estimated via slip trace analysis. Moreover, the
  effect of static recovery was investigated by additional two-step tension tests with
  intermediate annealing at 498 K. The microstructure development due to recovery was analyzed
  via ex-situ EBSD scans by analyzing the grain average misorientation, kernel average
  misorientation, and in-grain misorientation axis evolution. Experimental results were
  interpreted using crystal plasticity simulations based on the incremental elasto-visco-plastic
  self-consistent polycrystal model ($\Delta$EVPSC). Remarkably, a single set of parameters sufficed to
  describe the complex anisotropic and temperature-dependent behavior of the Mg-Zn-Nd-Y-Zr alloy
  by utilizing a dislocation density-based hardening model (DDH). The recovery, mainly of
  non-basal dislocations, significantly affected the flow stress responses, which allowed not
  only to describe the hardening behavior but also the anisotropy, characterized by the
  R-value and texture.},
